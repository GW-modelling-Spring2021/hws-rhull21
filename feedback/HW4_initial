Really good start.

1. Can you redo this with the well centered?  This will tie together your
first and second answers.  That said, your answers are good for the Well
location that you used.  Just be a bit more specific about how the well
pumping rate and location lead to nonuniform flow across the boundary!

2. Really good work on this ... good idea to show more transects.  Let's discuss
for sure!  The key is to think of the system holistically.  In particular,
what is happening downgradient of the well!

3. For the final answer, maybe also show the impact of pumping on all of the
cells.  Then you can contrast the capture zone and zone of influence of the
well.

4. Partially correct.  Explain a bit more why these boundaries lead to noncircular
drawdown.  But, they SHOULD be circular right near the well.  Why aren't they?

5. Good catch on the 'flip' that the built in python plotting routines do.  Just
keep this in mind if you make your own plots at some point!!  Let's be sure to
discuss the impacts of boundaries.  Please remember to bring it up!
