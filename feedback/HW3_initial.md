Really good starts on these!  Your intuitive sense is bang on ... see the flow around the rock example.  I'd just like you to think one step further.  WHY is the flow limited to the area close to the inclusion instead of spreading out up/down?  For the last question, I wanted you to compare, for example, K_background = 1 with K_inclusion = 0.1 to K_background = 10 with K_inclusion = 1.  Give that a think.
