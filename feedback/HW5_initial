Excellent work!

I don't follow this point 'Question: I don't think this
formulation capture quite accurately the physics of this question. This
explanation doesn't quite make sense in terms of a multi-cell-thick domain.'
Can you explain what you mean?

For this one 'Question: What is exactly is meant by the binary between flow
'in the system' and flow 'represented' in this question?' your answer hit the
mark.  If this was actually happening in a system, as described, flow would be
2D (can you see why it isn't 3D?)  The model structure is 3D (arguably 2D).
But, the model represents flow as purely horizontal with no component into
the page ... 1D.

I like your plan view maps, too.  Follow on question ... how will the concentration
in the well compare to the concentration of the recharge water?
