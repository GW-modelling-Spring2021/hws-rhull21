Excellent work ... 100%!  Great question about how to apply the insights about
nonlinearity to a real aquifer.  Please remember to remind me of this in class
today!  I LOVE that the recharge conversation was heated :)  We will also
discuss the calculation of the concentration in the well based on breaking
out the inflow from the boundary and the irrigated water ... I may ask you to
lead that discussion in one room!

May I share your HW as examplary this week?  The only thing that I would ask is
that you highlight questions for me to make sure that I see them!
